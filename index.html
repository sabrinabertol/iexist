          your life is your life<br>
          don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission.<br>
          be on the watch.<br>
          there are ways out.<br>
          there is light somewhere.<br>
          it may not be much light but<br>
          it beats the darkness.<br>
          be on the watch.
          the gods will offer you chances.<br>
          know them.<br>
          take them.<br>
          you can’t beat death but<br>
          you can beat death in life, sometimes.<br>
          and the more often you learn to do it,<br>
          the more light there will be.<br>
          your life is your life.<br>
          know it while you have it.<br>
          you are marvelous<br>
          the gods wait to delight<br>
          in you.<br>

            Cogito, ergo sum, (Latin: “I think, therefore I am) dictum coined by the French philosopher <strong>René
              Descartes</strong>
            in his Discourse on Method (1637) as a first step in demonstrating the attainability of certain knowledge.
            It is the only statement to survive the test of his methodic doubt. The statement is indubitable,
            as Descartes argued in the second of his six Meditations on First Philosophy (1641), because even
            if an all-powerful demon were to try to deceive him into thinking that he exists when he does not,
            he would have to exist in order for the demon to deceive him. <strong>Therefore, whenever he thinks, he
              exists.</strong></br>

            especially with Heidegger, Jaspers, Marcel, and Sartre, and is opposed to philosophical rationalism and

          <p id="textarea2">
            Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated.
            It is often associated with <strong>extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns
              existence.</strong>
            A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps,
            an impulse to destroy. While few philosophers would claim to be nihilists,
            nihilism is most often associated with <strong>Friedrich Nietzsche</strong> who argued that its corrosive
            effects would eventually destroy all moral, religious, and metaphysical convictions and precipitate
            the greatest crisis in human history. In the 20th century, nihilistic themes–epistemological failure,
            value destruction, and cosmic purposelessness–have preoccupied artists, social critics, and philosophers.
            Mid-century, for example, the existentialists helped popularize tenets of nihilism in their attempts to
            blunt its destructive potential. By the end of the century, existential despair as a response to nihilism
            gave way to an attitude of indifference, often associated with antifoundationalism.</br>
